        asteroid_observations = A dictionary in which the keys represent asteroid IDs

        The output of the `predict_from_observations` function should be a dictionary of tuples
        of estimated asteroid locations one timestep into the future
        (i.e. the inputs are for measurements taken at time t, and you return where the asteroids will be at time t+1).

        A dictionary of tuples containing i: (x, y), where i, x, and y are:
        i = the asteroid's ID
        x = the estimated x-coordinate of asteroid i's position for time t+1
        y = the estimated y-coordinate of asteroid i's position for time t+1
