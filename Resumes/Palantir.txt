The top 3 most important things to me in my next role are learning, 
interesting work, and work-life balance. Learning is my number one priority especially since I am a new grad 
and want to learn as much as possible to become a better engineer. I am also really interested in working on projects that 
I find interesting (which Palantir has plenty of) 
and finally I am also focused on having a good work-life balance so I don't feel burnt out after a couple of months of working.

At my current position, I am working on a team that is creating on a cloud-native Mission Planning System web application for NASA.
 My responsibilities on the project are to create GraphQL queries to get data from our database to the front-end, 
help design the relational data model of the application and define and implement front-end features 
that NASA mission planners requested to be added during our monthly demos.

The current project I am on is by far the hardest thing I have worked on. The reason for that was because of the 
huge learning curve there was at the beginning of the project and even now. I started working on this project as an intern 
and when I joined the team I assumed I knew enough to contribute right away but I quickly learned that was not the case. 
I had to learn about new tools that I had no experience with such as Docker, 
AWS, and GraphQL very quickly to be able to complete the tasks I was given.

I want to work at Palantir because of the impact the companies products have on the country and the world. Products 
like Gotham helps save lives and keep this country safe. The idea of working on such impactful products is really cool and exciting. 
I have also heard really great things about the culture of the company. One of my relatives worked at Palantir back when 
they were a new grad and said it is a great place to learn and everyone is very supportive.
